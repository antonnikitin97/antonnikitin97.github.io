## Welcome to my website!

My name is Anton, I am a recent graduate in Electronic Engineering and I currently work full time as a hardware engineer at a company that develops RF Spectrum monitoring equipment!

I have an interest mainly in digital and embedded systems.

On this website I'll write about different aspects of my life, as well as any personal projects that I'm currently working on!

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/antonnikitin97/antonnikitin97.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
