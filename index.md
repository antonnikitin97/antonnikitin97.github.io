## Welcome to my website!

My name is Anton, I am a recent graduate in Electronic Engineering and I currently work full time as a hardware engineer at a company that develops RF Spectrum monitoring equipment!

I have an interest mainly in digital and embedded systems.

On this website I'll write about different aspects of my life, as well as any personal projects that I'm currently working on!

### Projects

Here are some projects that I've been working on: 
* [Project Vostok - An Extension to the TV-B-Gone](https://github.com/antonnikitin97/ProjectVostok)
  * The aim of this project is to take the popular TV-B-Gone device and modify it to include an LCD screen, firmware will be written to allow the user to select from the various
  TV options.
* [Project Buran - A home-made StreamDeck](https://github.com/antonnikitin97/project_buran)
  * The aim of this project is to make my own version of the StreamDeck for my [Twitch Stream](https://www.twitch.tv/tohaaaa97). Hardware, Firmware and a GUI will be developed to allow control of StreamLabs OBS.
