## Welcome to my website!

My name is Anton, I am a recent graduate in Electronic Engineering and I currently work full time as a hardware engineer at a company that develops RF Spectrum monitoring equipment!

I have an interest mainly in digital and embedded systems.

On this website I'll write about different aspects of my life, as well as any personal projects that I'm currently working on!
